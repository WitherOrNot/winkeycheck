# winkeycheck

A tool to check product keys for Windows and Office

**Warning:** This tool consumes 1 activation for each product key tested.

A pkeyconfig file (resembling `pkeyconfig-xyz.xrm-ms`) is required to use this. The pkeyconfig for Windows 11 22H2 is included by default. Other pkeyconfig files (sourced from [SimplePidX](https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/simplepidx-simple-yet-powerful-product-key-checker.80300/)) can be downloaded [here](https://files.catbox.moe/9tkls4.7z).
